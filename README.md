## Background

Understanding microstructure-property relationships (MPRs) in random porous media is a fundamental challenge across numerous scientific and engineering disciplines. Image-based poro/micromechanical modeling offers a powerful noninvasive technique to investigate MPRs via numerical simulations; however, the stochastic nature and inherent randomness of porous media necessitate extensive datasets of 3D digital microstructures for reliable statistical analysis. Stochastic microstructure reconstruction provides an efficient and cost-effective approach to generate large numbers of virtual microstructures using limited statistical information from real porous materials, establishing it as a critical tool for advancing research in this field.
